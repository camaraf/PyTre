# PyTre


PyTre supports the development and testing of Travel Behavior embeddings. In its first version, PyTre can be used to encode categorical variables. 

If you’re interested in using PyTre, you’ll need a few Python packages installed:
- General stuff: pandas, sklearn, numpy, matplotlib, pickle, scipy, tempfile, adjustText
- Deep Learning: tensorflow, keras
- For using the notebooks: collections, pylogit

To understand and try the concept of travel embeddings, we recommend to read the paper "Rethinking  travel behavior modeling representations through embeddings" (https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.00154), and to run the "PyTre_swissmetro_paper.ipynb” notebook.

If you want to use this in your research, please cite:
